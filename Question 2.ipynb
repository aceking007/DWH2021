    "A little while later you stumble upon a population of wild rabbits of different colour that fascinates Dr. Michael, the population geneticist. He is fascinated by the colours ranging from blue to red. He has a task in mind but as with Dr. Dwight, he doubts whether you can solve the task, so he wants to test you on your knowledge of Mendel’s Laws and probability. He asks the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a single ancestor with the genotype AaBb in the 0th generation. The ancestor mates with another individual with genotype AaBb to produce offsprings. In the first generation the ancestor has 2 children. At each generation, a successor organism mates with a foreign individual with genotype AaBb to produce 2 children.\n",
